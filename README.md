# File-Sorting-Application

Many a times, we get some folders mixed up with different types of file and we want to sort them so that they look less cluttered.
It can be done by using the inbuilt windows option of view by type and then copy-pasting in different folder.
                   

By using python, this whole process of copy-pasting is done away with just one program.

### I have designed this windows application where user has to input source path and destination path for different file extension type and with one click on the button, it sorts the folder.
